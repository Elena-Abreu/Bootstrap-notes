let a = 100;

//a==b means it will check if both values are the same , so true or false 
//a!=b checks if both values are different  
//a===b compares total and datatype , if they are both the same like a=b then it will compare the datatype being the same (numbers..?) so if one has quotes its false
console.log(a === b);
